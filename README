Skeletons Collection
---------------------

Eray Ozkural, February 2001, Ankar


This package contains various skeleton projects for C/C++. Their
common feature is that they try to be generic, consistent, minimal
and portable using only standard libraries.

They are intended to be good starting points to write pure C/C++ programs
under GNU/Linux systems. Thus, they assume a recent version of gnu
tool chain.

The most recent one is cxx

auto-cxx:
  ANSI C++ skel code that uses autoconf/automake

c:
  ANSI C skel code with just a small makefile

cxx:
  ANSI C++ skel code with a full featured build system that uses only GNU make

c++:
  Like cxx but with different file naming

deep:
  A recursive source tree

doc:
  Documentation

start-old:
  An old skeleton code


Yes, I know that there are other skeleton collections around, but
you will see that this one has especially nice code in cxx and has
a slightly different approach.
